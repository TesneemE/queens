## Project Execution

The project involves:
1. **Demographic Analysis:** Utilizing data from [Social Explorer](https://www.socialexplorer.com/profiles/essential-report/index.html) to understand the population characteristics of each neighborhood.

2. **Affordable Housing:** Investigating obstacles faced by renters in light of rising rents. Exploring factors specific to our neighborhood that may influence the ease or difficulty of renting.
  
3. **Highlighted Map:** Creating a highlighted map centered around our neighborhood. This involves manipulating image brightness using Python. 

4. **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the [Affordable Housing Production by Building](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Affordable-Housing-Production-by-Building/hg8x-zxpr) dataset to report on the number of buildings, units, and projects in each neighborhood.
   
5. **Neighborhood Map:** Utilizing folium to generate an HTML map with markers highlighting affordable housing in your neighborhood.

6. **Website Development:** Creating a user-friendly and informative website to present the project findings. The website uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to ensure effective navigation and visualization of the gathered data.
